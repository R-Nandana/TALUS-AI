# TALUS — Physics-Informed AI for Open-Pit Mine Slope Risk Intelligence

> **Phase II + Phase III implementation** for an end-to-end Machine Learning / Data Science project.

TALUS is a decision-support prototype that combines **geotechnical telemetry, preprocessing, physics-based Factor of Safety, supervised ML, local explainability, temporal history and an API-first control-room UI**.

It is deliberately designed so the dashboard does not contain a hidden copy of the prediction logic. The architecture is:

**Processed data → Physics Engine + ML → XAI → SQLite → FastAPI → Streamlit Control Room**

## What is implemented

### Phase II
- **User Interface + Backend Connectivity:** Streamlit communicates with FastAPI over HTTP. The UI does not silently run the model locally when the API is down.
- **Preprocessing + EDA:** 1,200 slope telemetry records, 480 rock/soil records and 320 image-derived feature records are available in processed artifacts. The Data Intelligence page exposes distributions, correlations, material statistics and image-texture analysis.
- **Model Building:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are evaluated. The persisted metadata records the selected model and selection metric.
- **Result Analysis + Business Insights:** physics category, ML probability, local contributors, engineering recommendations, risk distribution and temporal trajectories.

### Phase III
- Dockerized backend and frontend
- Docker Compose for local demonstration
- Render blueprint for cloud deployment
- `/health`, `/docs`, `/model-info`, `/data-summary`, `/predict` and telemetry history endpoints
- Automated API/physics/data-driven tests
- GitHub Actions CI
- Demo runbook, viva questions, report and presentation

## Data-driven sector registry

The original prototype contained a manually seeded six-sector database even though the processed telemetry contains more sectors. The Phase III version derives the sector registry from `data/processed/cleaned_features.csv`. Therefore the dashboard currently reflects the dataset's **10 sectors (S1–S10)** instead of an artificial S1–S6 limit.

## Model evidence

The extended benchmark selects the serving classifier by **mean stratified 5-fold macro-F1**, not by accuracy alone. The current selected model is Support Vector Machine. The selected-model held-out split and all four candidate CV results are persisted in `models/model_metadata.json`, `results/model_comparison.csv`, and `results/ml_rigor_summary.json`.

| Selected-model held-out metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Selected model | Support Vector Machine |
| Selection rule | 5-fold stratified CV macro-F1 |
| Accuracy | 0.8417 |
| Macro precision | 0.7643 |
| Macro recall | 0.8403 |
| Macro-F1 | 0.7940 |
| Weighted-F1 | 0.8447 |
| ROC-AUC (macro OVR) | 0.9668 |
| Training records | 960 |
| Test records | 240 |

These are offline metrics on the supplied **synthetic** dataset, not evidence of operational mine-site performance. See `results/ml_rigor_summary.json` for CV mean ± standard deviation, the factor-of-safety ablation, sector hold-out, per-class metrics and calibration score.

## Local run

### 1. Install

```powershell
python run_backend.py
```

### 3. Start frontend in another terminal
```powershell
python run_frontend.py
```
Open `http://127.0.0.1:8501`.

### 4. Test
```powershell
pytest -q
```

## Docker

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8501`
- API: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Cloud deployment

The repository includes `render.yaml`, `Dockerfile.backend` and `Dockerfile.frontend`. Deploy the blueprint, then verify:

1. backend `/health` returns `healthy`
2. frontend environment variable `TALUS_API_URL` points to the backend service
3. frontend can load the Mine Overview without local fallback

## Viva-ready architecture explanation

**Why FastAPI?** It separates the inference service from the UI and creates a reusable API for future web/mobile/voice clients.

**Why physics-informed ML?** Factor of Safety provides an engineering stability signal while ML learns patterns from multiple telemetry variables.

**Why XAI?** A risk label alone is not enough for a decision-support system. Local contributors help the user understand which inputs influenced the prediction.

**Why SQLite?** It provides lightweight persistence for the academic/demo environment and makes temporal risk analysis reproducible. A production system could replace it with PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB.

## Important limitation

TALUS is **not an operational mine-safety authority or autonomous control system**. The supplied project data is synthetic/demo-oriented. Before real deployment, the system needs real mine-site data, external validation, uncertainty estimation, sensor QA/QC, temporal/sector holdout evaluation, drift monitoring, access control and certified geotechnical review.

## Extended control-room build (October 2026)

The project now includes the following additional offline-first prototype features:

- **Executive Summary** and **3D Mine Model** pages, with procedural terraced terrain, risk-colored sector markers, a schematic slope section, a PCA feature-space view and displacement playback.
- **Materials Gallery** with local rock/soil images and an upload classifier trained from `data/processed/image_features.csv`.
- **ML Rigor** artifacts generated by `scripts/train_ml_rigor.py`: stratified 5-fold CV with macro-F1 mean/std, four-model comparison, FoS ablation, 8-sector/2-sector hold-out, classwise precision/recall, reliability curves and multiclass Brier score.
- **SHAP global bar, beeswarm and local waterfall** artifacts from `scripts/generate_shap_explanations.py`. This analysis uses a separate research Random Forest so it does not misrepresent the selected serving SVM's explanations. The serving API also provides local perturbation contributors and permutation importance is saved as a fallback.
- **TALUS Voice** with a deterministic local intent parser endpoint and browser speech API where supported.
- **Alert Console** with SQLite persistence, Level 0–3 prototype alerts, acknowledgement/history, duplicate suppression, browser tone demo and a clearly labeled S4 severe synthetic demo.
- **Virtual Scenarios** with six conceptual animations/checklists and **Advanced Analytics** with 5,000-sample illustrative Monte Carlo, inverse-velocity indicator and two physics response surfaces.
- Per-sector PDF report endpoint, uploaded-image classification endpoint, system health endpoint and API smoke tests.

### Reproduce ML-rigor artifacts

```powershell
python scripts/train_ml_rigor.py
python scripts/generate_shap_explanations.py
```

The training script selects the serving classifier by mean stratified 5-fold macro-F1 and saves its metadata while preserving existing metadata keys. The supplied class counts are imbalanced (Critical 554, High 405, Moderate 211, Low 30); macro-F1 is therefore reported alongside weighted-F1 and accuracy. FoS is related to the synthetic target construction, so the ablation is a dependence check, not proof that the feature is or is not leaked in real operational data.

### Verification

```powershell
pytest -q
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```

### Prototype limitations that remain

- The terrain, cross-section, and scenario animations are conceptual. They are not photogrammetric geometry, finite-element simulations or validated 3D failure mechanics.
- Browser speech recognition support varies and may rely on browser services; text input is the dependable fallback. The intent parser itself is rule-based and offline.
- The alert tone is user-triggered, and the S4 demo is synthetic. No always-on 60-second escalation daemon, real worker geofencing, emergency dispatch, SMS, email or Telegram integration is enabled.
- Monte Carlo parameter spreads are stated assumptions rather than distributions calibrated from field measurements. Inverse-velocity estimates are explicitly indicative.
- The image classifier and suggested cohesion/friction ranges are visual aids only, not geological identification or laboratory strength results.
- User roles, authentication, audit-grade authorization, formal drift gates and validated mitigation-gain estimates are not production implementations.
